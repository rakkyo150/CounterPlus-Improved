## Differences from the original version
In ScoreCounter, ProgressCounter, CutCounter, NoteCounter, NoteLeftCounter, and SpeedCounter, it is now possible to add an arbitrary color for each arbitrary threshold. <br>
The default thresholds and colors are rather sketchy, so you may want to customize them to suit your needs. <br> 

## Settings
Please note that only the parts that differ from the original version will be covered.

### ScoreCounter
Threshold and color are divided into 7 levels.<br>
If you enable Colored HUD of NalulunaCounters, you can't use this.
