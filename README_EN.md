# (Improved)CounterPlus

## Differences from the original version
In CutCounter, NoteCounter, NoteLeftCounter, and SpeedCounter, it is now possible to add an arbitrary color for each arbitrary threshold. <br>
The default thresholds and colors are rather sketchy, so you may want to customize them to suit your needs. <br>
